# "Tea Bowl"

For my fourth tea bowl project, I made more of a bottle shape that really isn't a bowl at all. The assignment was to make a tea bowl that breaks the rules and I didn't really know what to do with it so I ended up making it like the Estus Flask from Dark Souls:

A heart-shaped box for Valentine's Day:
